Objectives for Python-based High Content Image Analysis
see: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000603

To Do: Function Modules Needed
- Load image(s)
- Plot histogram
- Illumination correction (The illumination function can be calculated by median filtering or by fitting a polynomial or spline surface, with the latter two being more resilient to overfitting and therefore more robust. Lindblad)
- Threshold foreground/background
-- global threshold first?
-- find local maxima?
-- watershed?
-- segmentation?
-- measurement?
- Split clusters of objects


- Count cells
- Determine size of objects
- Determine object intensity
- Measure shape descriptors (aspect ratio - width vs height, compactness - squared perimeter divided by the area, Zernike shape features)
- Measure Texture (statistical texture descriptors such as moments of the intensity histogram, structural and spectral texture descriptors)
- Clustering (number of neighboring objects, percent of perimeter touching neighbor objects, distance to nearest neighbor)
- Machine-learning scoring/classification for image analysis
