Naming convention rules:
1. Avoid extra long folder names and complex hierarchical structures but use information-rich filenames instead.
2. Put sufficient elements in the structure for easy retrieval and identification but do not overdo it.
3. Use the underscore (_) as element delimiter. Do not use spaces or other characters such as: ! # $ % & ' @ ^ ` ~ + , . ; = ) (
4. Use the hyphen (-) to delimit words within an element or capitalize the first letter of each word within an element.
5. Elements should be ordered from general to specific detail of importance as much as possible.
6. The order of importance rule holds true when elements include date and time stamps. Dates should be ordered: YEAR, MONTH, DAY. (e.g. YYYYMMDD, YYYYMMDD, YYYYMM). Time should be ordered: HOUR, MINUTES, SECONDS (HHMMSS).
7. Personal names within an element should have family name first followed by first names or initials.
8. Abbreviate the content of elements whenever possible.
9. An element for version control should start with V followed by at least 2 digits and should be placed as the last most element. To distinguish between working drafts (i.e. minor revisions) use Vx-01->Vx-99 range and for final draft (i.e. major version release) use V1-00-> V9-xx. (where x =0-9)
10. Prefix the names of the pertinent sub-folders to the file name of files that are being shared via email or portable storage devices.
